# Project Repo for CU Boulder CSCI4830-004 FL2016.

The primary purpose of our project was to use to train a model that could play Tic-Tac-Toe against itself, or against a human player. We used Reinforcement Learning with a Reward based on a modified Sigmoid function.

**What's Included**

* ProjectWriteup.pdf is the report on the project. It explains in detail what we did.
* LaTEX Files is a directory containing all of the files that were used to create ProjectWriteup.pdf
* AI.py is the Machine Learning side of the program. This is what actually learns how to play the game.
* tictactoe.py is our command line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe.
* play.py pulls in the other two python files and allows you to play the game.
* p1save and p2save are the saved data from training the model as player 1 and player 2.
